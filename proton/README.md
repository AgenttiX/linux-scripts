Create your account on the [Square Enix website](https://secure.square-enix.com/account/app/svc/ffxivregister?lng=en-us) or a Windows installation of the game.
Don't use the Linux installation for the account creation, or you may not be able to login for 24 hours.
Download the game and open it once.
You should get a buggy window.
Close it and then run `ffxiv.sh`.
Open the launcher.
The login button of the launcher does not work, but you can press enter to log in.
Click play to launch the game, and then close it.
If you try to play, you should get a black screen.
Run `ffxiv.sh` again.
The game should now be ready to play.
